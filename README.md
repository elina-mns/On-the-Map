# On-the-Map

## _Description_

On-the-Map is an application which shows a geolocation pins information posted by other students. 
The map contains pins that show the location where other students have reported studying. 
By tapping on the pin users see a URL for the links other users find interesting. 
The user is able to add their own data by posting a string that can be geocoded to a location, and a URL.

This project is a part of my iOS online degree which allows to post, authenticate a user and to retrieve data from a network resource using Apple’s networking framework. 

The app has three view controller scenes:
* Login View: Allows the user to log in using their credentials, or using their Facebook account
* Map and Table Tabbed View: Allows users to see the locations of other students in two formats  
* Information Posting View: Allows the users specify their own locations and links

## _Skills that were developed_

* Accessing networked data using Apple’s URL loading framework
* Authenticating a user using over a network connection
* Creating user interfaces that are responsive, and communicate network activity
* Use Core Location and the MapKit framework for to display annotated pins on a map
